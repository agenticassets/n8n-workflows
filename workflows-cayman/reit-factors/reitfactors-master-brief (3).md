## 1) Purpose
A single, comprehensive record that combines the full context: the research paper and model, the website/platform, the monetization posture (public vs. gated), external interest (FTSE / Nareit), the webinar and REITworld timeline, and the publication objective as a strategic edge. This document is descriptive, not prescriptive.

## 2) Snapshot — Where We Are (as of Oct 27, 2025)
- **Paper / Model**: We developed a **REIT‑specific asset‑pricing model**. It adapts traditional equity factor ideas to the REIT universe and **performs better** than generic equity factors for REITs (cross‑sectional fit and performance).  
- **Website / Platform**: **reitfactors.ai** is live with core pages and an **interactive dashboard**. The site will serve as the hub for factor definitions, analytics, and controlled data access (Fama‑French–style library, tailored to REITs).  
- **Business Direction**: This is **not** a public service. There will be a **limited public layer** for credibility and discovery, while the **core value is gated** (datasets, analytics, reports, advisory, index/benchmark alignment, and REIT‑focused AI/RAG).  
- **External Interest**: Parties from **FTSE** and **Nareit** have engaged with us. A **webinar** has been requested to walk through the paper, the website/dashboard, and the data/analytics. **Nareit** invited us to **REITworld 2025** (Dallas, **Dec 8–11, 2025**), providing **complimentary tickets** and warm **introductions**; the event is a key venue for meetings.

## 3) Dual‑Pillar Strategy (Combined)
**A) Academic Validation (Publication Track) for out Paper Titled "REIT Factors"**  
- **Objective**: Secure publication in a top field journal to anchor credibility and create a durable edge.  
- **Current Path**: Submission to **Real Estate Economics (REE)** in Fall 2025; if needed, consider a secondary outlet.  
- **Outputs**: Peer‑reviewed article, formal factor definitions, methodological appendix, and reproducibility references.  
- **Role in Business**: Academic validation complements commercialization and strengthens institutional trust in the platform and data.

**B) Commercial Monetization (Platform & Services)**  
- **Intent**: Translate the research into **revenue‑producing offerings** with institutional polish.  
- **Public vs. Gated**:  
  - **Public** (limited): High‑level summaries, selected demo views, and basic charts for credibility.  
  - **Gated (commercial)**: Full factor library access, advanced analytics, reports/notes, advisory deliverables, and index/benchmark alignment; AI/RAG tools; export/API capabilities.

## 8) Webinar — What Will Be Shown (as discussed)
- **Paper & Model**: Problem framing, factor construction concept, headline findings.  
- **Platform Walkthrough**: Website structure, dashboard views, data/analytics enabled by the library.  
- **Applications**: Research usage, portfolio analytics, and the **index/benchmark** concept at a high level.

## 10) Messaging Snapshots (for intros/emails)
- **One‑Line**: **REITFactors.ai** combines **top‑journal academic validation** with a **commercial REIT factor platform** — gated datasets, advanced analytics, advisory, and index alignment, built by PhD‑level experts with institutional focus.  
- **Elevator (Short)**: We built **REIT‑specific asset‑pricing factors** that outperform generic equity factors for REITs and turned them into a **commercial platform**. A limited public layer shows credibility; the **gated core** includes the factor library, analytics, notes, advisory, index alignment, AI/RAG, and data/API access. Publication (REE path) strengthens the edge.
