### A. Buy-Side Portfolio Manager / Analyst
**Subject:** Quick meet at REITworld to share REIT factor results

Hi [First Name],  
I’m Cayman Seagraves at the University of Tulsa. My coauthors (Mariya Letdin, Stace Sirmans) and I built **REITFactors.ai**, a research-grade factor library and strategy set derived from our REIT-specific asset pricing paper. We’re doing a joint Nareit webinar and will be at REITworld in Dallas Dec 8–11.  

If helpful, I can show a 10–15 minute walk-through: factor definitions, portfolio construction, and recent attribution for [Firm / REIT universe]. Would you have time on **Mon Dec 9 or Tue Dec 10 morning**?

### B. Forwardable Blurb via Nareit (John Worth)
**Subject:** Intro: REITFactors.ai — REIT-specific factor model and data library

John — thanks again. Here’s a short forwardable note for introductions:

Hi [First Name],  
John Worth suggested I reach out. I co-authored a REIT-specific factor model now live at **REITFactors.ai**. We’re doing a Nareit webinar and will be at REITworld. If you have 15 minutes in Dallas, I’d love to share how the factors perform vs. broad equity models and how we deliver data, analytics, and custom screens for [Firm].  
Best,  
Cayman

### C. Independent Research & Data Providers (e.g., Green Street)
**Subject:** Potential fit: REIT factor library + analytics overlay

Hi [First Name],  
We’ve operationalized a REIT-specific factor set with consistent out-of-sample performance and a production data pipeline at **REITFactors.ai**. Given your research coverage and advisory work, there could be a clean fit for **factor overlays, screens, or custom indices** that complement your platform.  

Are you open to **a 20-minute whiteboard in Dallas** on [date]? I’ll bring a short deck and sector attributions.  
Thanks,  
Cayman

### D. Sell-Side Equity Research (J.P. Morgan, KeyBanc, Truist, etc.)
**Subject:** Dallas touch-base: REIT factor drivers and attribution tools

Hi [First Name],  
I co-authored a REIT-specific factor model and launched **REITFactors.ai** to make the data and strategy views accessible. We’re presenting the framework with Nareit and would value a short discussion on **factor drivers, dispersion, and regime shifts** we’re seeing across sectors.  

Could we grab **15 minutes at REITworld** [preferred date/time]? I can send a 1-pager and example attributions in advance.  
Best,  
Cayman

### E. Buy-Side Quant / Multi-Manager Teams
**Subject:** Dallas micro-session: plug-ready REIT factors for live workflows

Hi [First Name],  
We’ve packaged REIT-specific factors with **clean identifiers, stable point-in-time fields, and weekly refresh** so teams can drop them into risk, signal, or PM workflows quickly. If your group covers listed real estate, I can share **implementation notes, coverage stats, and live attribution**.  

Available **Mon–Tue at REITworld** for a short demo?  
Best,  
Cayman

### F. REIT Corporate IR / CFO
**Subject:** Share a short factor-attribution view on [Ticker] at REITworld

Hi [First Name],  
I’m a finance professor and co-author of a REIT factor model we’re presenting with Nareit. We built **REITFactors.ai** to make it practical. If useful, I can share a concise **factor-attribution snapshot for [Ticker]** vs. peers and discuss what has driven relative performance and risk over the past 12–24 months.  

Could we meet **on site in Dallas** for 15 minutes? I’ll bring a one-pager for your team.

Hi [First Name],  
Following your outreach, we’d welcome a short meeting at REITworld to review **factor construction, eligibility rules, reconstitution impacts, and drift** in listed real estate. We can also share comparative results between REIT-specific and broad-equity models.  

Would you have **30 minutes on Dec 9 or 10**? I’ll send the deck and methodology note ahead of time.  
Thanks,
