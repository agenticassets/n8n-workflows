## Multi-Modal Property Assessment Architecture

### Data Integration Strategy
- **Parallel Processing**: Run image analysis, text extraction, and geospatial data collection simultaneously
- **Sequential Synthesis**: Feed all collected data into automated valuation model (AVM)
- **Output Generation**: Create comprehensive PDF reports with confidence scores and comparables

### Tool Configuration Requirements
- **Image Analysis**: Configure computer vision APIs (Google Vision/OpenAI Vision) for property condition assessment
- **Text Processing**: Implement NLP for lease document analysis and amenity extraction
- **Geospatial Tools**: Integrate GIS APIs for location intelligence and neighborhood demographics
- **Valuation Engine**: Use ensemble ML models combining all data modalities

### Workflow Execution Flow
- User uploads property data → Parallel analysis tools activate → AVM synthesizes results → Report generator creates deliverables
- Maintain 20-turn conversation memory for follow-up questions and clarifications
- Provide confidence intervals and key drivers for all valuations

### Real Estate Application Focus
- **Target Users**: Appraisers, lenders, real estate investors, property managers
- **Value Proposition**: Reduce assessment time from days to minutes with improved accuracy
- **Data Sources**: Satellite imagery, street photos, floor plans, listing descriptions, GIS data
