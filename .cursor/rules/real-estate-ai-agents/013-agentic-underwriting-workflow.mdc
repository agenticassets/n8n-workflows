## Multi-Agent Underwriting Orchestration

### Agent Hierarchy Design
- **Master Orchestrator**: Coordinates entire underwriting process and manages agent handoffs
- **Document Parser Agent**: Specializes in lease document analysis and financial term extraction
- **Financial Modeler Agent**: Builds DCF models, sensitivity analysis, and comparable transactions
- **Risk Assessor Agent**: Conducts environmental, legal, and market risk evaluations
- **Report Synthesis Agent**: Compiles comprehensive underwriting memoranda
- **Quality Assurance Agent**: Performs final validation and audit trail documentation

### Workflow Execution Sequence
- **Initiation**: Master orchestrator receives underwriting request with property documents
- **Parallel Processing**: Document parser and risk assessor work simultaneously on initial analysis
- **Sequential Integration**: Financial modeler uses outputs from first two agents
- **Synthesis**: Report synthesis agent creates final memorandum
- **Verification**: Quality assurance agent validates entire package with confidence scoring

### Agent Communication Patterns
- **Shared Global Memory**: Maintain workflow state across all agents with 20-turn context
- **Specialized Models**: Use GPT-4 for orchestration, GPT-4o-mini for specialized agent tasks
- **Tool Integration**: Each agent has dedicated tools for their domain expertise
- **Error Escalation**: Complex issues automatically escalate to human underwriters

### Underwriting Standards Compliance
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain complete documentation of agent reasoning and data sources
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provide quantitative confidence levels for all recommendations
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Include required disclosures and risk mitigation strategies
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Target commercial lenders, institutional investors, and investment banks
