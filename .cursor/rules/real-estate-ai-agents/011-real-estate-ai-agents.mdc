## Real Estate AI Agent Architecture

### Multi-Agent Workflow Design
- Structure agents hierarchically: Orchestrator → Specialized Agents → Tool Execution
- Use webhook triggers for real-time agent activation and scheduled triggers for monitoring
- Implement conversation memory (BufferWindow) with 20-30 turn context for complex interactions
- Connect agents via shared memory buffers and workflow orchestration nodes

### Agent Tool Integration Patterns
- **HTTP Request Tools**: Use for external APIs (CoStar, FRED, OpenMeteo) with proper authentication
- **Calculator Tools**: Implement for financial modeling, sentiment analysis, and risk calculations
- **Workflow Tools**: Enable agent-to-agent communication and complex multi-step processes
- **Vector Store Tools**: Integrate RAG capabilities for document retrieval and knowledge base access

### n8n Workflow Best Practices
- **Node Connections**: Use clear data flow from triggers → agents → tools → outputs
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error paths and fallback mechanisms
- **Memory Management**: Configure appropriate context windows and cleanup strategies
- **Credential Security**: Never expose API keys in workflow JSON; use environment variables

### Real Estate Domain Integration
- **Data Sources**: Integrate CoStar, REIS, Zillow, FRED API, and local government databases
- **Analysis Types**: Support multimodal analysis (text, images, geospatial, financial data)
- **Output Formats**: Generate PDF reports, HTML dashboards, and structured JSON responses
- **Compliance**: Implement audit trails and data privacy protections

### Agent Specialization Patterns
- **Assessment Agents**: Focus on property valuation and condition analysis
- **Underwriting Agents**: Handle due diligence and risk assessment workflows
- **Portfolio Agents**: Manage investment optimization and market timing
- **Intelligence Agents**: Provide market research and sentiment analysis
- **Orchestrator Agents**: Coordinate multiple specialized agents
