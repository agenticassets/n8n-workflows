## Reinforcement Learning Portfolio Optimization

### Continuous Learning Framework
- **State Assessment**: Evaluate current portfolio against benchmarks and target allocations
- **Market Intelligence**: Gather real-time data from CoStar, REIS, Zillow, and Federal Reserve APIs
- **Opportunity Scanning**: Identify off-market deals, distressed assets, and development opportunities
- **Risk Evaluation**: Run Monte Carlo simulations and stress testing scenarios
- **Action Selection**: Generate optimal buy/sell/hold recommendations with timing optimization

### Decision-Making Tools
- **Performance Analytics**: Calculate IRR, Sharpe ratios, alpha generation, and risk metrics
- **Cost Optimization**: Estimate transaction costs, bid-ask spreads, and market impact
- **Rebalancing Engine**: Execute optimal portfolio adjustments with tax-loss harvesting
- **Stress Testing**: Run climate risk integration and interest rate sensitivity analysis

### Portfolio Management Objectives
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Maximize returns while maintaining target risk profiles
- **Cost Efficiency**: Minimize transaction costs and tax impacts through optimal timing
- **Market Adaptation**: Respond to changing market conditions in real-time
- **Liquidity Management**: Balance illiquid real estate holdings with market opportunities

### Institutional Investor Focus
- **Target Stakeholders**: Pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, family offices
- **Value Proposition**: Enable continuous optimization in illiquid markets beyond quarterly rebalancing
- **Performance Metrics**: Track alpha generation, risk-adjusted returns, and market timing accuracy
