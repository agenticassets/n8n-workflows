- Implement API endpoint tests for all FastAPI routes with proper status code validation
- Create database operation tests for indexing, search, and FTS5 functionality
- Test workflow JSON parsing and node analysis for data integrity
- Validate categorization accuracy with known service-to-category mappings
- Implement smoke tests for critical paths: database connection, API responses, search functionality
- Test error handling for malformed workflows, missing files, and database failures
- Validate naming convention transformations with comprehensive test cases
- Test performance benchmarks: sub-100ms search, efficient indexing, memory usage
- Use sample datasets for testing to avoid full workflow processing in CI/CD
