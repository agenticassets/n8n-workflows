- Remove all credentials, API keys, and sensitive data from workflow JSON files before storage
- Implement data sanitization to strip personal information and authentication tokens
- Use environment variables for database paths and configuration to avoid hardcoded secrets
- Validate all workflow JSON parsing to prevent malicious code execution or data injection
- Implement proper error handling that never exposes stack traces or sensitive information
- Use parameterized database queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Validate file uploads and JSON parsing with size limits and structure validation
- Implement access controls and audit logging for sensitive operations
- Document data retention policies and provide clear privacy notices for workflow usage
