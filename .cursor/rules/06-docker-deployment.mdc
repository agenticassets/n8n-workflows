- Use multi-stage Docker builds with Python slim images for optimized production images
- Implement security best practices: non-root user, minimal attack surface, proper file permissions
- Configure health checks with curl commands to verify API endpoint availability
- Use volume mounts for persistent data: database and workflow directories
- Set proper environment variables: PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1, WORKFLOW_DB_PATH for configuration
- Implement restart policies and proper container resource management
- Use Docker Compose with named networks and container naming for service discovery
- Include database initialization and directory creation in Docker setup
- Support both build-from-source and pre-built image deployment options
