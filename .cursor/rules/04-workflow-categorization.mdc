- Follow naming convention: [ID]_[Service1]_[Service2]_[Purpose]_[Trigger].json
- Use intelligent capitalization: HTTP→HTTP, API→API, webhook→Webhook, automation→Automation
- Implement automatic service detection from filename tokens and node analysis
- Map integrations to 16 business categories using context/def_categories.json
- Store category assignments in context/search_categories.json for search filtering
- Use regex normalization to handle integration name variations and special characters
- Support partial matching for common service name variations
- Validate categorization accuracy with manual review and automated testing
- Maintain unique_categories.json as authoritative category reference
