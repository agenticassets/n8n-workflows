# Writing Effective Cursor Project Rules (.mdc)

This guide explains how to design, structure, and maintain highâ€‘impact Cursor project rules for this codebase. It reflects current 2025 practices and the conventions already used here.

## What project rules are
Project rules are versioned instructions stored in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` that guide Cursor Agent and Inline Edit. They are included in prompts based on the rule type and `globs` scope.

## Rule anatomy (frontmatter + body)
Keep frontmatter minimal and consistent:

```md
---
description: Concise, action-oriented summary (<= 60 chars)
globs: path/pattern1,another/pattern2,one/more/**
alwaysApply: false
---

- Actionable bullet one
- Actionable bullet two
```

Notes:
- Use one-line, comma-separated `globs` (house style).
- Prefer `alwaysApply: false` unless the rule is very small and universally safe.
- Put additional details in the body, not in frontmatter.

## Rule types (how they attach)
- Always: Always included in context (use sparingly; small rules only).
- Auto Attached: Included when referenced files match `globs` (default for most rules).
- Agent Requested: Available for the agent to attach when relevant; requires a good `description`.
- Manual: Only included when explicitly mentioned (e.g., `@004-auth-and-middleware`).

Set the type from Cursor's Rules UI; the file content uses the same frontmatter either way.

## Content style
- Be specific and imperative: "Use NextAuth v5 server-side sessions; never expose tokens client-side."
- Encode decisions and constraints the model must follow, not vague suggestions.
- Prefer short, scannable bullets; group by topic.
- Include references to local files with `@path/to/file.ts` when useful.
- Keep rules under ~100 lines. Split by domain when they grow.

## Naming and organization
- Use numeric prefixes to convey category and ordering:
  - 001-099: Core and AI integration
  - 100-199: (unused yet)
  - 200-299: (unused yet)
  - Add new rules after existing numbers (e.g., 008-...)
- Keep domain-specific topics separate (auth, testing, deployment, streaming/RAG, etc.).

## Globs: house patterns
- Single line, comma-separated list, no quotes: `globs: app/**,components/**,middleware.ts`
- Prefer precise scopes: target only where the rule applies.
- Common examples in this repo:
  - App routes/components: `app/**/*.ts,app/**/*.tsx`
  - Components: `components/**`
  - Server/db: `lib/db/**`
  - AI: `lib/ai/**,app/(chat)/api/chat/**`
  - Testing/config: `tests/**,playwright.config.ts`

## Templates

### Short "standards" rule (Auto Attached)
```md
---
description: API route input validation and error patterns with zod
globs: app/**/api/**,lib/**
alwaysApply: false
---

- Validate all request bodies with zod schemas before use.
- Return 400 with details on validation errors; never leak stack traces.
- Use NextResponse.json({ error: '...'}, { status }) for errors.
- Log errors server-side; never include secrets in error messages.
- Add or update route tests under tests/routes/ for new endpoints.

@tests/routes/document.test.ts
```

### Domain rule (Manual or Agent Requested)
```md
---
description: UI component patterns with Tailwind and shadcn/ui
globs: components/**,app/**/*.tsx
alwaysApply: false
---

- Prefer RSC; mark interactive components with 'use client'.
- Style with Tailwind utilities; reuse shadcn/ui where available.
- Keep props typed; avoid any. Co-locate variants with components.
- Use Suspense/Skeletons for async boundaries.
- Avoid inline secrets/env; read from server boundaries only.
```

## Referencing local files
Add `@relative/path` lines to have Cursor include those files as context whenever the rule attaches. Use for canonical examples, schemas, or config.

Examples:
- `@lib/ai/models.ts` for abstract model IDs
- `@lib/ai/providers.ts` for provider mapping
- `@middleware.ts` for protected route matcher

## What to put in rules vs code
- Put non-obvious constraints, repeatable patterns, naming, architecture decisions, and error handling policies in rules.
- Keep implementation details in code (and tests); reference them from rules with `@file` lines.

## Testing rules work
1. From Cursor, open the Rules panel; ensure the rule is present and of the expected type.
2. Open a file that matches `globs`; confirm the rule shows as Active.
3. Manually tag a rule in chat: `@005-testing-and-quality` to include it.
4. Verify behavior (e.g., the agent follows the constraints) or ask: "Which rules are active now?"

If a rule does not attach:
- Check `globs` spelling (house style: one line, comma-separated).
- Ensure `.mdc` extension and file in `.cursor/rules/`.
- Provide a meaningful `description` (required for Agent Requested).
- Restart Cursor if UI shows stale rule metadata.

## Anti-patterns to avoid
- Bloated frontmatter (only keep `description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply`).
- Vague bullets (e.g., "Write good code"). Make them testable.
- Over-broad `globs` that pull rules into unrelated edits.
- Giant single rule files. Split by domain at ~300-500 lines.
- Duplicating the same guidance across multiple rules (link with `@file` instead).

## Repo-specific best practices
- Use abstract model IDs from `lib/ai/models.ts` and provider mapping in `lib/ai/providers.ts`.
- Handle xAI exhaustion with user-friendly messages in chat routes; hide provider details.
- Keep streaming architecture (`createUIMessageStream`, `smoothStream`, `JsonToSseTransformStream`).
- Use Drizzle migrations in builds (Vercel); never hardcode secrets.
- Maintain tests with Playwright; ensure `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` pass prior to commit.

## Maintenance checklist
- Rule has clear `description` and minimal, one-line `globs`.
- Scoped and actionable bullets; no filler text.
- Links `@file` for canonical examples where helpful.
- Sized reasonably; split when too long.
- Verified attaches to intended files and not to others.

## Quick start: create a new rule
1. Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P -> New Cursor Rule.
2. Fill frontmatter using the house style (one-line `globs`).
3. Add 5-15 focused bullets; include `@file` references as needed.
4. Choose type (Auto Attached is typical) in the Rules UI.
5. Test attachment with a matching file open.
