## Core Workflow Development Patterns

### Category-Based Workflow Design
- **Communication & Messaging** (321 workflows): Telegram, Discord, Slack webhooks for notifications and chat bots
- **Business Process Automation** (77 workflows): Google Calendar/Cal.com scheduling, task management, workflow orchestration
- **Data Processing & Analysis** (125 workflows): ETL pipelines with Google Sheets, databases, analytics platforms
- **AI Agent Development** (4 workflows): Multi-agent systems with OpenAI/Anthropic, vector stores, intelligent automation
- **Web Scraping & Data Extraction** (264 workflows): HTTP requests, APIs, data collection tools

### Node Best Practices
- **Triggers**: Webhook for APIs, Schedule for time-based, Manual for user-initiated workflows
- **Actions**: HTTP Request for APIs, Code/JavaScript for transformation, Function items for logic
- **Flow Control**: Split In Batches for bulk ops, Switch for conditions, Merge for data streams
- **Integrations**: Prefer service-specific nodes (Google Drive, Slack) over generic HTTP requests

### Multi-Agent Architectures
- **Orchestrator Pattern**: ExecuteWorkflow node coordinates specialized agent workflows
- **Chain of Thought**: Sequential OpenAI nodes with memory buffers for complex reasoning
- **Parallel Processing**: Split In Batches for concurrent agent execution
- **Feedback Loops**: Memory buffers for self-improvement cycles

### Integration Examples
- **AI**: OpenAI + Pinecone for RAG, Anthropic + LangChain for orchestration
- **Communication**: Telegram + OpenAI chatbots, Slack + Google Calendar coordination
- **Data**: PostgreSQL + Google Sheets sync, Airtable + Zapier automation
- **Business**: HubSpot + Stripe sales, Trello + Gmail notifications
